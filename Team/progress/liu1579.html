				<h4>Week 2:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 08/31/2018
				<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 6
				<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
				<br> During the second week, I mainly worked on identifying major constrains and potential problems that might pose potential
				obstacles which maybe stymie our progress in the futures. I successfully identified several problems and constrains such
				as the voltage thresh-hold values potentially for the motors, the size of the battery that the boat might need, and the
				different modules that the boat might need to communicate with user interface compatibly. After identifying the problems
				and constrains, I worked with the team to select potential microcontrollers and modules for the design project. To suit
				the need of transmitting image signal and GPS coordinate signal from the boat to the user interface and meeting the power
				constrains since the boat would be powered by 18650 batteries, I selected the STM32 low power series as the main microcontroller,
				but the specific model of STM32 is still under team discussion. With the microcontroller being decided, the LTE cellular
				module was also being decided, which is STM32-C2C/LTE IoT. With those important microcontroller and modules being selected
				and putted into order, the next step of mine would be working with the team to design the actual circuit and the physical
				boat itself. Additionally, I worked on parts of the functional specification assignment with the team which is the team
				assignment for the week.

			<h4>Week 3:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 09/07/2018
			<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 10
			<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
			<br> During the first half of the week, I started to identify and select specific electronic components that the project
			needs and discussed with my team to finalize the candidate lists for each component. With the constraints of voltages
			of 3.3V to 5V, power limits since the boat and all microcontroller would be powered by the 18650 battery units, numbers
			of I/O pins, and functions of the microcontroller required because of the nature of the project involving multiple components
			and modules cooperating with each other. Thus, selecting the brushless DC motors for the boat and the garbage conveyor
			belt became a crucial step for further selections of the microcontroller with these design constraints in mind. First,
			I selected the Light Dependent Resistors as the main component of the features of detecting whether the garbage storing
			unit is full or not. since the other break beam sensorsâ€™ sensing distance is either too long or too short for the needs,
			making an LDR controlled transistor circuit with a red laser beam becomes the best option with easy controlling of the
			sensing distance. So, I built an LDR circuit making a LED lights on when the LDR could no longer detect the light source.
			The LED could be replaced by directly connecting to the microcontroller, making the LED into a merely analog output value
			and could be converting into a digital signal value thus could be further interpreted and processed by the microcontroller.
			In the circuit shown below, the potentiometer is used to adjust the resistance of the output voltage value so the voltage/power
			output would not exceed the microcontroller's limit.

			<br>Brushless DC motors is selected as the main drivers for the boat and the conveyor belt. The ASR-00016 brushless DC
			motors is selected as the motor for conveyor belt because of its relatively high torque, motor speed, and low price. Another
			brushless DC motor featuring Electronic Speed Control becomes the better choice than the brush DC motor, since it would
			be easier to monitor and control the speed of the boat. 9T 4370KV + waterproof with ESC was picked because this specific
			module features relatively high ESC continuous and burst current and low price. Its size and weight are also within the
			constraints of the boat. I also started to do some researches and studies about the ESC and learn about the ESC firmware
			that would require the interfacing with the microcontroller STM32L4 on boat. The circuit designing for powering and controlling
			the ESC with microcontroller is also under the way. Beside those tasks, I also helped the team to select other components
			such as WiFi module, and GPS module. I also started to design the software and firmware algorithm with the team, trying
			to come up with an algorithm which would constantly adjust the direction of the boat toward a fixed set coordinate. This
			algorithm would be performed in the computer through the user-interface.

		<h4>Week 4:</h4>
		<b>Date:</b> 9/14/2018
		<br>
		<b>Total hours:</b> 15
		<br>
		<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
		<br> For the first half of the week, I started to build the prototype circuit of the Light Dependent Resistor for detecting
		the capacity of the circuit. The design was relatively simple in designing phase involving an essential Light Dependent
		Resistor connecting with the base of the a 2N3906 PNP transistor and a 1K ohm resistor and a 2K ohm resistor; the emitter
		end is connected directly to the battery, and the collector is attached with a red LED to indicate the sensing of the Light
		Dependent Resistor. The PNP transistor on this particular circuit functions more like a switch which will output a low
		voltage value 0.32V and turn off the LED when the LDR detects a direct light source and output a relatively high voltage
		value 1.67V and turn on the LED when the LDR could not detect any direct light source. To interface this circuit with the
		microcontroller and make it work as a capacity indicator, the microcontroller could be connected in parallel with the LED
		output thus monitoring and recording the analog voltage value. In the microcontroller, the analog voltage output gets converted
		to the digital data and store in a memory address which will be sent to the user-interface through UART peripheral via
		WiFi communication. I got the LDR from the ECE supply room, the resistance of the LDR when detecting no light is about
		4K ohm and the resistance of the LDR when detect a direct light source is about 0.15K ohm. The PNP transistor used is 2N3906,
		which is different from the original design component. Thus, the design for the break beam sensing circuit is modified
		to accommodate the existing components, and the 10K ohm potentiometer is removed since there will be no need to adjust
		the voltage output of the LED after team discussion about the microcontroller interfacing. The circuit schematic and graphical
		demonstrations are shown below.

		</figure>
		<br>Beside modifying and building the break beam sensing circuit, I also started to design the circuit for connecting the
		motor with the ESC and to the microcontroller. By researching the brushless DC motor and the ESC, turns out that some ESCs
		require special receivers to program the ESCs first to drive the motors with the ESCs. More researches and progresses will
		be made during the weekend to program the ESCs so both motors could be driven by the ESCs.

		<br>For next week, I will start to work on making the actual boat using wood with teammates. I will also start to interface
		electrical components with the microcontroller through multiple peripherals once the development environment being set
		up by the teammates.
