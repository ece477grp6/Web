This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

				<h2>Progress Report for Tianjie Jia</h2>
<div>
				<h4>Week 1:</h4><img src="Team/img/Tianjie1.jpg" style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px"></img>
				<b>Date:</b> 8-24-2018
				<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 5
				<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
				<br>In week 1, I worked on the final proposal, modified the overall model and package of the boat to reduce water drag and to make collecting garbage easier to perform. The hand drawing image is shown below. 
				<br>In the meanwhile, I also involved in modifying the project description, taking roles and assign individual tasks among team members, and setting up PSSC. I helped to make each PSSC into independent one, which means each PSSC should not interfere another, so that one failure could not affect the other and lead a total failure of the project. In the progress of the project, we will also separate tasks into different categories.</br>

				<h4>Week 2:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 8-31-2018
				<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 6
				<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
				<br>In week 2, I modified PSSC based on the suggestion staff given, and edited Functional Specification Document. I looked into the general functional description, theory of operation and several design constrains of the project. In the theory of operation, helped the team find the feasible microcontroller with function of cellular radio module, and I came up with the idea of sensoring the filling situation of the storage room using infrared detector. In the mechanical constrains, I suggested using net conveyor belt for a better catching floating object purpose.</br>
