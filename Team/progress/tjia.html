					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week 1, I worked on the final proposal, modified the overall model and package of the boat to reduce water
					drag and to make collecting garbage easier to perform. The hand drawing image is shown below.
					<br>In the meanwhile, I also involved in modifying the project description, taking roles and assign individual
					tasks among team members, and setting up PSSC. I helped to make each PSSC into independent one, which means each
					PSSC should not interfere another, so that one failure could not affect the other and lead a total failure of the
					project. In the progress of the project, we will also separate tasks into different categories.</br>

					<h4>Week 2:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 8-31-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 6
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week 2, I modified PSSC based on the suggestion staff given, and edited Functional Specification Document.
					I looked into the general functional description, theory of operation and several design constrains of the
					project. In the theory of operation, helped the team find the feasible microcontroller with function of cellular
					radio module, and I came up with the idea of sensoring the filling situation of the storage room using infrared
					detector. In the mechanical constrains, I suggested using net conveyor belt for a better catching floating object
					purpose.</br>

					<h4>Week 3:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 9-07-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 10
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week3, the team is working on finding appropriate hardware component and design of the software. I have a detailed look at the motor that drive the belt. Low RPM and high torque become the criteria of choosing one. I check several vendors like DigiKey, Mouser, Sparkfun and so on. I realize the importance of a datasheet, which contain the most detailed information of a product. When I check those retailer website, the original data sheet of the motor somehow already lost, thus, much information are not recorded well. Sometimes I can trace it back to the relative first-hand seller and sometimes it’s very hard to find the original information. Besides the functional data, the shape of the shaft is also a consideration in comparison, because the shape of the shaft determine whether the gear can be easily mounted or not. 
					<br>
					<br>I also come up with the algorithm of the computing auto cruse using data from GPS and Compass. I have two thoughts in mind, one is to go forward and turn at the same time, and the other is to turn to the right direction first then go forward. These two method each has pros and cons, but the first one comes out to be the more efficient and feasible one, because it has less phase of operation and real-time adjusting.
					<br>
					<br>At this stage, I’m going to make a prototype of the boat by CAD it. The most important criteria of that is to estimate the weight of the total boat and design how much water the boat need to drain. Plus, I need to design a drawer like storage room.

					<h4>Week 4:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 9-14-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 15
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week 4, I made the CAD model of the boat using CATIA, which I learned in CGT163 in my freshmen year. To make the CAD model is just technic work, but to design what the boat will be look like needs deep thinking. First, I estimate the weight of the boat, including the motors, batteries and some other module which don’t count that much compare to the previous ones. Then the cabin is designed large enough to hold the weight of the boat, and to contain all the component on size as well. Other than that, the balance of the boat also matters a lot. When I design the storage room, the intuitive thinking is a box shape room, but later on, a funnel shape comes to my mind which increases the total storage room space and solve the water draining problem as well. The structure on top of the storage room is used for GPS, Compass and Camera module, it is also the skeleton of solar panels. When designing this structure, I consider the size of the garbage we need to collect, since the “roof” cannot block the garbage from getting into the storage room.

					<br>
					<br>Besides CAD model, I also look up the microcontroller board. The STM32L476G Disc board that we thought about using is already somehow implemented, which means most of pins already occupied to serve some specific task. However, it is not that friendly for us to burn code and add new features on to it, so I suggest we still keep using STM32F407 Disc first, which also has more reference to look up. 
					<br>
					<br>Next week, I will make the physical model of the boat first since the 3D printing method is denied. I will start to code the GPS and microcontroller first since it’s a crucial part of our design.

					<h4>Week 5:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 9-21-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 18
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					In week 5, I set up the microcontroller, the STM32F407. Use cube and HAL library to generate the skeleton of the firmware that we are going to use. I thought about using STM32L4 and STM32F0 family, but F4 has more peripherals compared to F0 and less occupied GPIO for those peripherals compared to L4. Although I have experience in programming F0, and the library are quite similar, it still take me some time to get familiar with the library code and peripheral setting. That reminds me again that if knowledge is not being used all the time, it's quite easy to lose them. I start with a TIM interrupt and blink the LED, then go to PWM to take the work from Arduino, since previously the ESC module is controlled by the PWM signal from Arduino. At first, I found that the voltage of PWM signal is 3V which is not high enough for ESC, so I decided to use a N-MOSFET to create a 5V PWM signal with the same duty cycle. However, it either decrease the voltage or invert the duty cycle which confused me a lot. Later on, I check what I learned in ECE255 and get to know that a MOSFET can only create an inverse signal because of its intrinsic mechanism, and in the circuit, a load is very necessary to drain that voltage. As an engineering student, I feel ashamed that I forgot all of those knowledge that I should command, but in the meanwhile, I feel fortunate that I can still trace them back and gain them again.
					<br>
					<br>Another major task is to set up the WiFi module, which is the most important communication bridge in our project. The ESP8266 talk to machine via UART. For convenience, I used the UART module connected to PC to set up connect WiFi first. During that process, I learned that the private IP address that the router gives to a device could change in few days, and I have to assign the ESP8266 a specific IP address to prevent it from changing. After that has been done, open the ESP8266 to the public internet is also a significant step. After the private IP address device is forwarded to public, every with internet access can sent signal to the device through public IP address. All of these are working fine with UART module and Putty interface, but when switching to the STM32F4 board, there is some issue with receiving the right response, and I will keep working on that later on.
					<br>
					<br>Next week I'm going to fix the WiFi module problem first, and then make GPS work with the STM32F4.

					<h4>Week 6:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 9-28-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 18
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>
					<br>In week6, I keep working on the WiFi module and the communication with the user interface. At the start, I used HTTP protocol and created a server which can be accessed with public internet. It is a very easy access, one can even use IE explorer to get a precise feedback, but the communication rate is slow because it delay for other information that is not needed in our case. Then I looked for a more convenient and economic way to communicate with the user interface. TCP protocol comes to be the best solution. With TCP protocol, the transmission rate is much faster, and neat messages are sent. The ESP8266 module can either create a server or be a client to access an external server using TCP protocol. Since the public address could change when creating a new server on the user interface with different internet connection, but the WiFi source we have on the boat is fixed. Thus making ESP8266 as a server is a clever choice. So far, the TCP signal from user interface can adjust the PWM signal to the ESC and motor rotation speed.
					<br>
					<br>Another major step I have is to record the voltage through ADC peripheral. It seems to be an easy step since we’ve all known how to control the brightness of an LED by a potentiometer through ATD and DTA. However, in our project we have a lot voltage need to be monitored through ADC. There are five break beam sensor made by LDR circuitry, whose voltage need to be monitored to see the fullness of the storage room. Besides we also have three battery groups and probably 9 cells in total to drive the circuity and motors, and the voltage of each of the cell needs to be monitored. We need over 10 ADC channels in total. With that amount of channels open, the sampling rate, interrupt rate and memory used are all need to be reconsidered. Now, the micro can transfer multiple channel inputs without interference, after I set the reasonable sampling cycles and open DMA mode.
					<br>
					<br>My next step is to get read from GPS and Compass. So far, the GPS UART transfer is done neatly, but the NMEA form is hard to parse into float coordinates. I will work on that next week.

					<h4>Week 7:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 10-5-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 13
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>
					<br>In week7, I work with Peiyuan together on the software part, and have done GPS communication properly. On the microcontroller, there are two UART peripheral open for GPS and Wi-Fi module. Initially, the buffer of both UART is single byte, which means, they read character by character. However, the GPS message transmission is very fast and leads to message leaking on the Wi-Fi communication. Then I change the buffer from a single byte to 512 byte, because our system does not require an extreme high speed refresh rate of GPS coordinates. A large buffer will discard some overlapped message but can at least extract one intact useful message with all the information we need. With this method, both GPS and Wi-Fi module can talk to micro well.
					<br>
					<br>Another aspect of the communication is between the micro and the user interface. On the micro side, every time it reboots, ESP8266 will be reset and get ready to be connected, once “OK” message is received. It is constantly hearing from the user interface, and once receive “command” from the user interface, it sends a series of information including GPS, compass, battery, and fullness of storage to the user interface. If the interface cannot connect to ESP8266, or any error or exception happens during the communication, it will print “connection error”. If interface successfully sends the message but cannot hear from the microcontroller, it will try to reconnect the Wi-Fi module and keep sending a message.
					<br>
					<br>Besides software part, I also help design the MOSFET switching circuit, and test the IC and other components we have. Next week I will prepare for the design review and test the Compass module.

					<h4>Week 9:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 10-19-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 19
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>
					<br>In week9, I work on Compass module MLX90393 Magnetic Node, the last module that we need to navigate the boat. The Compass IC is a 3mm small chip, first I solder it on a breakout board to give it a test. Then, the MLX90393 supports two communication method, SPI and I2C. I first tried SPI, but somehow it didn’t give and feedback, and I think this might be caused by hardware connection issue. The failure in SPI, lead me to implement I2C, and surprising it started to give feedback. However, the value it sent back, doesn’t make any sense to me, and I stuck there for a long while. Later on, with the help of Qianli, I found a post with an appropriate reference of code of using MLX90393. After that, I realized that, before it starts to read any value, I need to write some register to set sensitivity and some other parameter to make it functional on our way.
					<br>
					<br>Even though the compass starts to send x and y data of magnetic intensity, I expected that could be related to north on the map, but seems like without the help of GPS, with the data from the Compass module itself, there is no way to find north. I will look more into the way to find the direction of the boat.
					<br>
					<br>Another thing I work on is to complete the prototype. I think the package of the boat is actually a huge issue of us. The material we are going to use should be determined soon. The weight of the boat is significantly changed, so we need to redesign the height of the boat. As to collect the garbage, I find it hard to collect plastic bottle using a inclined belt, even with a fairly large friction. All of these issues should be put on table and resolve soon.

					<h4>Week 10:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 10-26-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 15
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>
					<br>In week 10, our PCB arrived, and we are doing some basic testing on that. I found a flaw on the hole of the connector of the power supply, and later we found that the size of hole in the eagle package has a very little deviation than the connector we received, around 1mm. However, luckily, it’s not a key component, and we can make fly wires. On the next version, we will fix the flaws.
					<br>
					<br>The major concern at this stage, is the package design, and I’m working on the CAD model of the boat hull. We decide to use wood board to make the boat hull and wrap it with fiber glass to make the body. I went to a site to learn how to make the boat hull and it’s quite a complicating process. As Todd said, it’s not easy to make a boat. I also went to BIDC and tried to get registered to use their machine. I want to use the Gantry Sheet Router to cut the wood board. I went to their website and finished three quizzes to get registered. After we buy the wood board, I will go to make an appointment.
					<br>
					<br>In this week, I also check some patent that our project may infringe on. There are very few products in the market that are similar to ours, and the patent we may have an issue with are: conveyor belt transfer and water contaminant cleaning system. When I looked up those patent, the description is very detailed, but even though, some device of invention are very hard to be depicted in mind.   
					<br>
					<br>In next week, I will hopefully finish the boat or at least the hull of the boat. I will also help on testing and soldering our PCB.

					<h4>Week 11:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 11-2-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 17
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week 11, I write a Matlab script to test the compass. I’ve written Matlab for years from time to time, but still, once I didn’t write the script for a while, it’s very easy to forget. Thus, it took me a lot of time to write the script to connect to serial port device and plot the scatter graph in real time. After I wrote the script, I began the test. The value of compass is too sensitive and unstable in the lab environment where electronic devices are all around. When I turned the compass 360 degree around, it still showed me a rough circle. I think it would be better once we move it outside on the water, but we urgently need the boat to give it a test.
					<br>
					<br>I also finish the design of the hull of the entire boat in 2D design, because we want to cut a 1/4in wood board. Initially, we wanted to use sheering router to cut the board, but when I went to BIDC, the staff recommended me to use Laser Cutter instead. The result turns out to be good as the picture shows below.
					<br>
					<br>Next week, I will work on the fiber glass and make the whole model of the boat ASAP. Then we can test our hardware and software in the real working environment.

					<h4>Week 12:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 11-9-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 19
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week 12, I did two major things. One is calibrating the compass, another is making the boat with fiberglass in BIDC.
					<br>
					<br>On the compass part, I soldered the break out board of the compass, and tested the function of compass module successfully. I also took the whole compass module including the micro outside of the building to test. Todd told us that compass requires a calibration step before putting into use. Until I took the module outside and found the difference of performance in different environment, I didn’t fully understand that why calibration is necessary. Afterwards, I found that if compass turns 360 degree around, the module returns bunches of points on Cartesian coordinate system which show as a circle. However, the central of the circle is not exactly <0,0>, and the center of the circle will vary in different environment. Thus, to calibrate the center of circle is necessary to know the angle.
					<br>
					<br>Besides that firmware part, I also spent two days in BIDC to make the boat. The fiberglass combined with epoxy resin provides a super robust and hard shell covered on the hull of the boat. The most important part in the manufacturing process is safety, especially when cutting the stiffened fiberglass, because the dust of fiberglass is irritant, and if inhaled by human beings, would cause a lot of damage to the respiratory system. We were very careful when we did hand on cutting and sanding the fiberglass. 
					<br>
					<br>Next week, I will keep making the boat and solder the PCB, and hopefully assemble the whole boat.

					<h4>Week 13:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 11-16-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 15
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>
					<br>In this week, I soldered part of the PCB, and assembled the boat. When soldering the PCB, many problems came out. Sometimes the copper wire on board was cut, or pad of a pin was dropped. Our teammate ruined one PCB, so when I did my job, I was very careful on each component I was soldering. I learned soldering long time ago, but to solder tiny flat resistors and capacitors is a new challenge to me. After several trials, I command the way to solder those quickly and neatly. During the process of testing after soldered one part of the board, I found more than one design problems on board. Some of them are simple connecting the wrong pin on the micro, like the TX and RX of the UART got switched. One time when we tried to test the voltage of the battery monitor, we found some weird value that is not the result of half voltage divided from the original voltage. Later on, I realized that we haven’t program the micro yet, and inside micro, there might be pull down resistor set as default, and thus without programing the micro, more resistors are in series. Now most part of the PCB are done soldering, GPS, Wi-Fi module and Compass are all tested and perform well on the board.
					<br>
					<br>Another thing I did this week is to glue the storage room with the side cabin. Since the surface of the cabin is made by wrapping fiberglass, it is not that flat as we thought, so the process to glue the wood box shaped storage room on to the rugged surface is very hard. I also found some bad design on the CAD, which causing part of the middle storage room goes under water. It reminds me of the fact that the first draft design is always not perfect, and a mature design has to be generated after multiple versions of trial and fix process. Though in this senior design project, we don’t have more time and space to update our design, in the future project design, I should always schedule time for updating.
					<br>
					<br>Next week I will leave for my thanksgiving trip, but I will still keep contact my teammates for any thing I can help.
