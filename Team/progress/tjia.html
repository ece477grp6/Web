					<b>Total hours:</b> 5
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week 1, I worked on the final proposal, modified the overall model and package of the boat to reduce water
					drag and to make collecting garbage easier to perform. The hand drawing image is shown below.
					<br>In the meanwhile, I also involved in modifying the project description, taking roles and assign individual
					tasks among team members, and setting up PSSC. I helped to make each PSSC into independent one, which means each
					PSSC should not interfere another, so that one failure could not affect the other and lead a total failure of the
					project. In the progress of the project, we will also separate tasks into different categories.</br>

					<h4>Week 2:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 8-31-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 6
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week 2, I modified PSSC based on the suggestion staff given, and edited Functional Specification Document.
					I looked into the general functional description, theory of operation and several design constrains of the
					project. In the theory of operation, helped the team find the feasible microcontroller with function of cellular
					radio module, and I came up with the idea of sensoring the filling situation of the storage room using infrared
					detector. In the mechanical constrains, I suggested using net conveyor belt for a better catching floating object
					purpose.</br>

					<h4>Week 3:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 9-07-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 10
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week3, the team is working on finding appropriate hardware component and design of the software. I have a detailed look at the motor that drive the belt. Low RPM and high torque become the criteria of choosing one. I check several vendors like DigiKey, Mouser, Sparkfun and so on. I realize the importance of a datasheet, which contain the most detailed information of a product. When I check those retailer website, the original data sheet of the motor somehow already lost, thus, much information are not recorded well. Sometimes I can trace it back to the relative first-hand seller and sometimes it’s very hard to find the original information. Besides the functional data, the shape of the shaft is also a consideration in comparison, because the shape of the shaft determine whether the gear can be easily mounted or not. 
					<br>
					<br>I also come up with the algorithm of the computing auto cruse using data from GPS and Compass. I have two thoughts in mind, one is to go forward and turn at the same time, and the other is to turn to the right direction first then go forward. These two method each has pros and cons, but the first one comes out to be the more efficient and feasible one, because it has less phase of operation and real-time adjusting.
					<br>
					<br>At this stage, I’m going to make a prototype of the boat by CAD it. The most important criteria of that is to estimate the weight of the total boat and design how much water the boat need to drain. Plus, I need to design a drawer like storage room.

					<h4>Week 4:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 9-14-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 15
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week 4, I made the CAD model of the boat using CATIA, which I learned in CGT163 in my freshmen year. To make the CAD model is just technic work, but to design what the boat will be look like needs deep thinking. First, I estimate the weight of the boat, including the motors, batteries and some other module which don’t count that much compare to the previous ones. Then the cabin is designed large enough to hold the weight of the boat, and to contain all the component on size as well. Other than that, the balance of the boat also matters a lot. When I design the storage room, the intuitive thinking is a box shape room, but later on, a funnel shape comes to my mind which increases the total storage room space and solve the water draining problem as well. The structure on top of the storage room is used for GPS, Compass and Camera module, it is also the skeleton of solar panels. When designing this structure, I consider the size of the garbage we need to collect, since the “roof” cannot block the garbage from getting into the storage room.

					<br>
					<br>Besides CAD model, I also look up the microcontroller board. The STM32L476G Disc board that we thought about using is already somehow implemented, which means most of pins already occupied to serve some specific task. However, it is not that friendly for us to burn code and add new features on to it, so I suggest we still keep using STM32F407 Disc first, which also has more reference to look up. 
					<br>
					<br>Next week, I will make the physical model of the boat first since the 3D printing method is denied. I will start to code the GPS and microcontroller first since it’s a crucial part of our design.
