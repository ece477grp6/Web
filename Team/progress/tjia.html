This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

					<b>Date:</b> 8-24-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 5
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week 1, I worked on the final proposal, modified the overall model and package of the boat to reduce water
					drag and to make collecting garbage easier to perform. The hand drawing image is shown below.
					<br>In the meanwhile, I also involved in modifying the project description, taking roles and assign individual
					tasks among team members, and setting up PSSC. I helped to make each PSSC into independent one, which means each
					PSSC should not interfere another, so that one failure could not affect the other and lead a total failure of the
					project. In the progress of the project, we will also separate tasks into different categories.</br>

					<h4>Week 2:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 8-31-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 6
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week 2, I modified PSSC based on the suggestion staff given, and edited Functional Specification Document.
					I looked into the general functional description, theory of operation and several design constrains of the
					project. In the theory of operation, helped the team find the feasible microcontroller with function of cellular
					radio module, and I came up with the idea of sensoring the filling situation of the storage room using infrared
					detector. In the mechanical constrains, I suggested using net conveyor belt for a better catching floating object
					purpose.</br>

					<h4>Week 3:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 9-07-2018
					<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 10
					<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
					<br>In week3, the team is working on finding appropriate hardware component and design of the software. I have a detailed look at the motor that drive the belt. Low RPM and high torque become the criteria of choosing one. I check several vendors like DigiKey, Mouser, Sparkfun and so on. I realize the importance of a datasheet, which contain the most detailed information of a product. When I check those retailer website, the original data sheet of the motor somehow already lost, thus, much information are not recorded well. Sometimes I can trace it back to the relative first-hand seller and sometimes it’s very hard to find the original information. Besides the functional data, the shape of the shaft is also a consideration in comparison, because the shape of the shaft determine whether the gear can be easily mounted or not. 
					<br>
					<br>I also come up with the algorithm of the computing auto cruse using data from GPS and Compass. I have two thoughts in mind, one is to go forward and turn at the same time, and the other is to turn to the right direction first then go forward. These two method each has pros and cons, but the first one comes out to be the more efficient and feasible one, because it has less phase of operation and real-time adjusting.
					<br>
					<br>At this stage, I’m going to make a prototype of the boat by CAD it. The most important criteria of that is to estimate the weight of the total boat and design how much water the boat need to drain. Plus, I need to design a drawer like storage room.
