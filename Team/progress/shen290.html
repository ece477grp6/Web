				<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
				<br>This week I searched different components that can be used for our project. Initially, we decided to have two paddles on the two sides the boat to drive the boat forward. The problem with the paddle design is that the water drug and friction faced by the paddle will be relatively high and the speed of the boat cannot be fast. After a search on the Internet with Qianli Ma, we found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x10Ozo7riEY">similar project</a> shown below and it is a better solution to the project. We noticed that many RC boats use turbojet to push the boat. For a motor with high KV and large torque, the turbo can provide large power to drive the boat. Therefore, we decided to put two turbojets at the end of the boat to push the boat forward and control the heading of the boat. <br>

				<br>Since we decided to take out the camera module from the microcontroller and use an out-of-box product instead, I searched online for the commercial products available. It turned out that most of the camera modules communicate through the radio at a high rate and using it requires a person to take a test and obtain a license. This complex process made our project less user-friendly. There also exists some camera modules that utilize Wi-Fi communication. Therefore, we decided to also change the communication method on the microcontroller from cellular radio data to Wi-Fi communication. We checked out the STM32F4 microcontroller and the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, as shown in the figure below.<br>
				<img src="Team/progress/img/peiyuan/ESP8266.jpg">
				<br>As the result, I changed our PSSCs this week. I sent the revised version of the PSSCs to the instructors and the TA. through email and it was approved on 09/07/2018. There were mainly two changes:
				<ul>
					<li>The second PSSC was modified. The project will now utilize Wi-Fi module to communicate between the boat and the user interface on the computer instead of cellular radio data.</li>
					<li>The fourth PSSC was removed since it largely overlapped with the first and third PSSC. Initially, we were planning to send the route set by the user directly to the microcontroller and let the microcontroller to decide the directions and the rotation speed of the motors. However, we believe that the calculation is too large to be performed purely on the microcontroller and thus we decided to let the computer program do the calculation and send the rotation speed of the motors to the boat. Regardless what operating mode the user selected on the user interface, the commands sent to the boat would always contain the same kind of information. Therefore, this PSSC was removed and I proposed a new one.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>For next week, I plan to set up the GUI through Qt on the computer. There is a open-source library on <a href="https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python">GItHub</a> that provides python API. Also, we plan to visit some parks nearby that has a lake and allows us to put the boat in it.<br><br>
