				<h4>Week 3:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 09-07-2018
				<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 10
				<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
				<br>This week I searched different components that can be used for our project. Initially, we decided to have two paddles on the two sides the boat to drive the boat forward. The problem with the paddle design is that the water drug and friction faced by the paddle will be relatively high and the speed of the boat cannot be fast. After a search on the Internet with Qianli Ma, we found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x10Ozo7riEY">similar project</a> shown below and it is a better solution to the project. We noticed that many RC boats use turbojet to push the boat. For a motor with high KV and large torque, the turbo can provide large power to drive the boat. Therefore, we decided to put two turbojets at the end of the boat to push the boat forward and control the heading of the boat. <br>

				<br>Since we decided to take out the camera module from the microcontroller and use an out-of-box product instead, I searched online for the commercial products available. It turned out that most of the camera modules communicate through the radio at a high rate and using it requires a person to take a test and obtain a license. This complex process made our project less user-friendly. There also exists some camera modules that utilize Wi-Fi communication. Therefore, we decided to also change the communication method on the microcontroller from cellular radio data to Wi-Fi communication. We checked out the STM32F4 microcontroller and the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, as shown in the figure below.<br>
				<img src="Team/progress/img/peiyuan/ESP8266.jpg" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
				<br>As the result, I changed our PSSCs this week. I sent the revised version of the PSSCs to the instructors and the TA. through email and it was approved on 09/07/2018. There were mainly two changes:
				<ul>
					<li>The second PSSC was modified. The project will now utilize Wi-Fi module to communicate between the boat and the user interface on the computer instead of cellular radio data.</li>
					<li>The fourth PSSC was removed since it largely overlapped with the first and third PSSC. Initially, we were planning to send the route set by the user directly to the microcontroller and let the microcontroller to decide the directions and the rotation speed of the motors. However, we believe that the calculation is too large to be performed purely on the microcontroller and thus we decided to let the computer program do the calculation and send the rotation speed of the motors to the boat. Regardless what operating mode the user selected on the user interface, the commands sent to the boat would always contain the same kind of information. Therefore, this PSSC was removed and I proposed a new one.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>For next week, I plan to set up the GUI through Qt on the computer. There is a open-source library on <a href="https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python">GItHub</a> that provides python API. Also, we plan to visit some parks nearby that has a lake and allows us to put the boat in it.<br><br>
			

				<h4>Week 4:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 09-14-2018
				<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 15
				<br>This week I was mainly working on the Graphical User Interface. I used PyQt to make the GUI. The interface mainly contains a web engine for the google map interface, a GraphicsView for the camera, a GraphicsView for the compass, an info board and two tabs that switch between the two operation mode. All the components are put in some kind of Layout such that it will adjust the size in proportion to the window size. Layout stretch is used to adjust the scale of the components inside the layout. One challenging part of the GUI is to interface with the google map API. I managed to set up a web view using JavaScript and stored as HTML inside the python code in order to display the actual map. There were many problems encountered during the process since Qt5.5 deleted the web widget and created a web engine class instead. All the functions inside this class were changed and thus all the existing codes interfacing with the google map cannot execute. The way to solve this problem is to use a call back function to collect the return value of the function since the run javascript function of qt5.5 is asynchronous. In order to use the Google Map API, one must register for a API key. I got a one-year free trial and every time Google Map API was used, it would be recorded as shown below. Makers can be added by clicking on the map and the coordinates values will be reported.<br>

				<br>In addition, we went to find a lake for our boat to test the GPS functionality. There is a lake call lake harner in Lafayette. The coordinates of this lake is {lat: 40.450, lng: -86.870}. I set the default location for our google map interface to be this lake.

				<br>For the next week, I plan to work more on the GUI and interfacing with the Google Map. I also plan to learn about some basic on how to build a boat. We are planning to build the boat body using wood and we are going to the shop to search for appropriate wood type to work on.<br>

				<h4>Week 5:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 09-18-2018
				<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 18
				<br>This week, I worked on building the boat prototype and figuring out how to use PWM to send signals to the ESC to control the speed of the motor. We went to the home depot last weekend to look for the material for prototyping the boat. As searched online for some common material used to build a boat. The material used is mostly balsa, fiberboard, basswood etc. We decided to use fiberboard because it is light and easy to work with. We can cut the board easily without using any advanced machine. We cut the board and used the hot glue gun to stick the board together as shown below. A small test on waterproofing was done shown below and it was proved that the fiberboard can be glued together to make the boat.

				<br>We were having some issue making the ESC working at the beginning of the week. With the power on and a valid PWM signal, only the fan of the ESC was working. The motor made a wired sound that does not match to any of the expected signals when connected to the power. I searched online and found an Arduino code to set up the ESC and control the speed up and down. The Arduino code worked. I measured the frequency and the duty cycle given by the Arduino and mimicked the waveform using the STM32F4. It did not work. I then realized that the voltage given from the Arduino is 5V whereas the voltage output of the STM32F4 was only 3V. I used a 2N7000 N-MOS to convert the 3V PWM to a 5V PWM with opposite duty cycle. The ESC still won’t work. The problem was that the duty cycle should increase and decrease continuously. It cannot handle a large duty cycle gap. It would stop working when suddenly change the duty cycle from 5% to 10%.

				<br>For the next week, I plan to work on improving the looks of the boat, finding out ways to correctly use the ESC because for now, the initialization process has to happen at the same time when connecting the ESC to the power. I also plan to start looking at how GPS and the compass work.
