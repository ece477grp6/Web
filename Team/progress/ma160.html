This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

				<h4>Week 2:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> Aug 31, 2018
				<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 4
				<br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
				<br> This week I continued on maintaining the team website, updating the PSSC and project description on the team
				website. During this week I was able to get the entire website online on the schools server. I also helped work on
				the functional specification with my team, going over the documentation with them.I looked into what
				microcontroller to be used and some other parts that could be used in our design, I have also started doing some
				research on what batteries to use along with solar charging solutions that could be used in our
				design.<br>
				The following documents were added to the website
				<ul>
					<li><a href="Files/docs/InitialProjectProposal.pdf">Initial Project Proposal</a></a></li>
					<li><a href="Files/docs/FinalProjectProposal.pdf">Final Project Proposal</a></li>
					<li><a href="Files/docs/FunctionalSpecification.pdf">Functional Specifications</a></li>
				</ul> <br>

				<h4>Week 3:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> Sept 7, 2018
				<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 5
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
				<br> This week I wrote a short script in bash enabling the schools server to pull from our Github repo every
				second so that every time a team member pushes to our repo reducing the number of times needed to manually log in
				or ssh into our team account and performing a git pull from Github. Following is the code snippet that I wrote:<br>
				<pre class="prettyprint linenums ">
#!/bin/bash
while :
do
	git checkout *
	git pull
	sleep 1
done
				</pre>
				The bash script was run used with the nohup command such that it is able to be run in the background from an ssh
				session and keep on running even if the ssh session is ended by the user. It also provides a log to nohup.out so
				that in case of any issues, I would able to debug it with the log file. Sample log shown below<br>
				<img src="Team/progress/img/qianli/autoupdate_nohup_log.png" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><br>

				During this week we also looked into what parts would be used in the final project, the main concerns that we are
				looking into are the brushless DC motors used to drive the boat. We initially looked into using propellers to drive
				the boat such as the one showing below on the left.<br>

				</figure>
				However we choose to use an turbojet style system such as the one shown above to the right. A turbojet system have
				the advantage of not being as likely to getting the propeller stuck by some aquatic plant or something like that.
				It also provides higher thrust when compared to a propeller system making it ideal for our use case, making it able
				to carry heavier loads and being able to drive the boat faster as well.
