This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

				<h4>Week 1:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> Aug 31, 2018
				<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 5
				<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Setup <a href="https://github.com/ece477grp6">Github</a> project for the team and added team members ssh-key
						along with team account's ssh-key to the Github account so everyone has access to the source code for the entire
						project including the website</li>
					<li>Setup team website</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Week 2:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> Aug 31, 2018
				<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 4
				<br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
				<br> This week I continued on maintaining the team website, updating the PSSC and project description on the team
				website. During this week I was able to get the entire website online on the schools server. I also helped work on
				the functional specification with my team, going over the documentation with them.I looked into what
				microcontroller to be used and some other parts that could be used in our design, I have also started doing some
				research on what batteries to use along with solar charging solutions that could be used in our
				design.<br>
				The following documents were added to the website
				<ul>
					<li><a href="Files/docs/InitialProjectProposal.pdf">Initial Project Proposal</a></a></li>
					<li><a href="Files/docs/FinalProjectProposal.pdf">Final Project Proposal</a></li>
					<li><a href="Files/docs/FunctionalSpecification.pdf">Fucntional Specefication</a></li>
				</ul> <br>
				<h4>Week 3:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> Sept 7, 2018
				<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 4
				<b>Description of design effors:</b>
				<br> This week I wrote a short script in bash enableing the schools server to pull from our Github repo every
				second so that every time a team member pushes to our repo reducing the number of times needed to manually log in
				or ssh into our team account and performing a git pull from Github. Following is the code snipet that I wrote:<br>
				<pre class="prettyprint">
					#!/bin/bash/
					while:
					do
				</pre>
				<pre>
					<code>
						#!/bin/bash/
						while :
						do
					</code>
				</pre>
