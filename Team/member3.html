            I am a passionate senior in computer engineering, having experience with robotics since a young age I like
            to fiddle around electronics and embedded systems. I also like to mess around computers and consider myself
            as a power user. Having a summer intern at NetEase Games allowed me to gain insight on network related
            projects. I find IoT devices and smart devices very fascinating and would become a part of our daily
            lifestyle in the future.
