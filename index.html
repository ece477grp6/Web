				<h2>Project Overview:</h2> The team proposes a garbage collecting boat that collects floating garbage on the water
				surface. For the scope of this project, we do not consider water flow. The mechanism used to collect garbage is to
				use an upsloping conveyor belt to filter out the trash and send to the storage space. Electricity stored in storage
				batteries would power the whole boat. Solar panels would be installed on the boat so that the solar power can be
				converted to electric energy and stored in the storage batteries. A computer would control the boat through
				Wi-Fi, and the Global Positioning System (GPS) would be available on the boat. When the garbage storage space
				inside the boat is full, or the boat is about to run out the power, the boat would send a warning signal to the
				computer and return to the starting point or a preset location. The boat would have two operation modes: fixed
				route mode, and manual mode. In fixed route mode, the boat would follow a route set was defined in advance with the
				assistant of GPS system. In manual mode, the heading would be manipulated remotely by a person from the computer in
				real time. There would be a camera on the boat that sends real-time image to the computer.


				<h2>Project Specific Success Criteria:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>PSSC #1: An ability to navigate the boat and steer the direction of the boat.</li>
					<li>PSSC #2: An ability to receive direction commands set by the user interface via Wi-Fi.</li>
					<li>PSSC #3: An ability to enter GPS coordinate points in the user interface and transmit commands to the boat.</li>
					<li>PSSC #4: An ability to pause the conveyor belt when the storage room is full.</li>
					<li>PSSC #5: An ability to monitor the battery life and storage room and send corresponding retreat signal to the
						user interface.</li>
				</ol>
